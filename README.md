# Spotify-ListLister

Lists spotify user's playlists.

Discovered a wonderful Spotify account that had over 6k playlists. Only 200 or so of them are displayed when looking at the profile through Spotify's website or app. Needed a way to list a list of all of their playlists so I can listen to the ones I'm interested in.

## Installation

1. Download the source.
2. Create the configuration file:
	- Rename listlister.conf.j2 to listlister.conf and fill in the fields.
	OR 
	- Create your own configuration file and supply the path to it with `-c` or `--cfg`.

Auth configuration is required:
```
[auth]
id = <App Client ID>
secret = <App Client Secret>
```

3. Install dependencies:
	- `pip install spotify`
	OR
	- If you have trouble install packages using requirements.txt in a fresh venv.

## Usage

Run help: 
`python listlister.py -h`

Which displays how to use the tool:
```
listlister.py [-h] -u USER [-i] [-t] [-c CFG] [-p] [-o OUT]

List users playlists and write them to file or terminal.

required arguments:
  -u USER, --user USER  User ID of whose playlists to list.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i, --id              Print playlist IDs instead of names. Works only for file output without tracks flag.
  -t, --tracks          Also list tracks inside the playlists.
  -c CFG, --cfg CFG     Path to configuration file. Defaults to listlister.conf.
  -p, --print           Output to terminal instead of file if this flag is set.
  -o OUT, --out OUT     Path to output file. Defaults to playlists-<USER>.out
```

# Play a random list

The second script `randomlist.py` can play a random playlist from a file generated by `listlister.py`

Essentially it will just pick a random line from a file and feed it into the command: `spotify play --playlist <Playlist Name>` OR `spotify play --uri spotify:playlist:<Playlist ID>` depending on if the "id" argument is set.

## Random list player installation

1. First install spotify: `pip install spotify-cli`
2. Login using one of its auth methods:
  - `spotify auth login`
  OR
  - `spotify auth login --client-id XXXXX --client-secret YYYYY`

## Random list player usage 

Run help: `python randomlist.py -h`

Which displays how to use it:
```
randomlist.py [-h] -pl PLAYLISTS [-i]

Play a random playlist from a list.

required arguments:
  -pl PLAYLISTS, --playlists PLAYLISTS
                        List where to pick a playlist from.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i, --id              Set this flag if playlist list is comprised of IDs not names.
```
